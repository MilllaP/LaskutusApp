# LaskutusApp
A GUI-based billing application designed using object-oriented principles. Features include multi-line item invoices, time and cost tracking, editable details, and automatic total calculation. Users can perform CRUD operations on invoices and product data. All data is stored in a database.

Replace <username> and <password> with your database login details in BillRepository.cs. 
HUOM! This is a practice application and it will create the required database automatically. If a database with the same name already exists, it will be deleted and replaced. Ensure you back up any important data or change the database name before running the application.
